In March, I was put on furlough due to Covid-19. I was expected to return in May. That turned into July. Then October. And now, the end of the year. Maybe.

While it was a rough reality from a company I have worked for for almost 7 years, I decided to make the most of it and took an online computer science class. What I had hoped would simply be a distraction, turned into a passion for a field I had previously thought I wasn't good enough for.

One of my favorite things about computer science is debugging. I know, it's so frustrating sometimes when you see that dreaded and unexpected error message and you're like "hey, why isn't this working?". But then you take a deep breath, take a walk, and reassess the situation. Then you come back with a fresh mind and tackle the error little by little.

I feel that's kind of how I've approached my furlough situation. I couldn't understand why I wasn't called back to work. I couldn't understand how Covid-19 had such devastating impacts to the travel industry, and in turn, my job. But I take a deep breath, take a walk, and reassess my situation. I tackle the issues one at a time and I know soon enough the error messages will be replaced with success. I will have learned more about myself through those error messages and I wouldn't be where I am right now, following the path to my dream job at a top bootcamp, without them.
