<p>It only took one coding course to fall in love. I dabbled in C with a little Python and a little SQL. While challenging, the dominating feeling was one of excitement- I could do this for a living. I'm a builder, and the feeling of seeing something you contributed to come to fruition... there's no better feeling. I'm also a learner, and, fortunately for me, I had found a field where the learning never stops.</p>
